# Lost Signal 🚀

Lost Signal is a simple, space-themed NFT widget project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).  
It imagines a scenario where forgotten digital messages drift through space — and one of them is this NFT interface.

This project is part of a demo exploring how embeddable marketplaces could look and feel.
